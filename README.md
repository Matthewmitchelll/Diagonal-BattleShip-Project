# Diagonal-BattleShip-Project

BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS FOR WHAT EVERY FILE IN THE PROJECT IS USED FOR:

RUNSIMS.JAVA - STARTING POINT OF THE PROGRAM, RUNS A GAME OF BATTLESHIP BETWEEN HUMAN
               AND COMPUTER, AS WELL AS SIMULATIONS BETWEEN COMPUTERS

BATTLESHIP.JAVA - USED FOR RUNNING A GAME BETWEEN A HUMAN AND COMPUTER

SIMULATOR.JAVA - ABSTRACT CLASS THAT LAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR SIMULATORS, TAKING IN
                 THE NUMBER OF GAMES TO SIMULATE AND A BOOLEAN VERBOSITY PARAMETER

BATTLESIMULATOR.JAVA - USED FOR RUNNING A GAME BETWEEN TWO COMPUTERS

TESTSIMULATOR.JAVA - USED FOR TESTING VARIOUS STRATEGIES BY PLAYING A GAME BETWEEN
                     A COMPUTER RUNNING A STRATEGY IN QUESTION AGAINST A DUMMY COMPUTER

STATE.JAVA - ABSTRACT CLASS REPRESENTING THE STATE OF A GAME FOR A PLAYER

PLAYERSTATE.JAVA - REPRESENTS A HUMAN'S STATE, USED FOR ASKING THE PLAYER HOW HE/SHE WOULD
                   LIKE TO PLACE HIS/HER SHIPS

COMPUTERSTATE.JAVA - REPRESENTS A COMPUTER'S STATE, USED TO SET THE STRATEGY THE COMPUTER
                     WILL RUN AND RANDOMLY CONFIGURE ITS SHIPS

TARGETER.JAVA - ABSTRACT CLASS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR TARGETERS, WHICH COMPUTERS USE TO
                EXECUTE THEIR STRATEGIES

RANDOMTARGETER.JAVA - TARGETER USED TO TARGET RANDOM LOCATIONS

SEEKINGTARGETER.JAVA - TARGETER USED TO SEEK LOCATIONS NEXT TO KNOWN OCCUPIED SQUARES

PRIORITIZER.JAVA - ABSTRACT CLASS (EXTENDING TARGETER) THAT LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR TARGETERS
                   THAT EMPLOY MEASURES OF UTILITY (AND NO RANDOMNESS) IN SELECTING THEIR NEXT
                   SQUARE TO TARGET

WEIGHTEDPRIORITIZER.JAVA - PRIORITIZER THAT TARGETS LOCATIONS BASED ON A WEIGHTED SUM OF 5
                           MEASURES OF UTILITY AND A PRIMITIVE FUNCTION FOR WEEDING OUT
                           IMPOSSIBLE SQUARES

COMMANDER.JAVA - PRIORITIZER THAT TARGETS LOCATIONS BASED ON DIFFERENT MEASURES OF UTILITY FROM
                 THE WEIGHTEDPRIORITIZER, AND USING A FULLY EXHAUSTIVE ALGORITHM FOR RULING OUT
                 ANY IMPOSSIBLE SQUARES

LOCATION.JAVA - REPRESENTS A LOCATION ON THE BOARD, DEFINES USEFUL DIRECTIONAL METHODS

SMARTLOCATION.JAVA - EXTENDS LOCATION BY STORING NUMEROUS MEASURES OF A LOCATION'S UTILITY
                     AND SOME METHODS TO RESET AND MAINTAIN THEM THROUGHOUT A GAME, USED BY
                     THE WEIGHTEDPRIORITIZER CLASS

TRACKERLOCATION.JAVA - EXTENDS SMARTLOCATION BY KEEPING TRACK OF ADDITIONAL MEAURES OF UTILITY
                       AND SOME METHODS TO RESET AND MAINTAIN THEM, USED BY THE COMMANDER CLASS

TARGETUTILITIES.JAVA - CONTAINS FUNCTIONS FOR UPDATING MANY OF SMARTLOCATION'S AND TARGETLOCATION'S
                       MEASURES OF UTILITY

BOARDUTILITIES.JAVA - STORES UTILITY METHODS NEEDED DURING A GAME, SUCH AS ONES TO PRINT
                      BOARDS AND LAY OUT SHIPS

SHIP.JAVA - STORES INFO ABOUT SHIPS (NUMBER OF SHIPS/SIZES OF SHIPS/TOTAL SQUARES OCCUPIED)

DIRECTION.JAVA - ENUMERATES ALL 8 POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS

WEIGHTFINDER.JAVA - USED TO FIND THE BEST CONFIGURATION OF WEIGHT FOR THE WEIGHTEDPRIORITIZER AND
                    COMMANDER TARGETERS (MOST RECENTLY UPDATED TO FIND WEIGHTS FOR THE COMMANDER)

DUMP.JAVA - FILE TO STORE UNUSED/OBSOLETE PORTIONS OF CODE (FOR REFERENCE)
